abstract: Detection of molecular residual disease (MRD) allows for the identification
  of breast cancer patients at high-risk of recurrence, with the potential that early
  initiation of treatment at early stages of relapse could improve patient outcomes.
  The Invitae Personalized Cancer Monitoringâ„¢ assay (PCM) is a newly developed next-generation
  sequencing approach that utilizes up to 50 patient-specific, tumor-informed DNA
  variants, to detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The ability of the PCM assay
  to detect MRD before clinical relapse was evaluated.
