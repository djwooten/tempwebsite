abstract: 'Even as the clinical impact of drug combinations continues to accelerate,
  no consensus on how to quantify drug synergy has emerged. Rather, surveying the
  landscape of drug synergy reveals the persistence of historical fissures regarding
  the appropriate domains of conflicting synergy models â€“ fissures impacting all aspects
  of combination therapy discovery and deployment. Herein we chronicle the impact
  of these divisions on: (i) the design, interpretation, and reproducibility of high-throughput
  combination screens; (ii) the performance of algorithms to predict synergistic mixtures;
  and (iii) the search for higher-order synergistic interactions. Further progress
  in each of these subfields hinges on reaching a consensus regarding the long-standing
  rifts in the field.'
