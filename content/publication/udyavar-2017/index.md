abstract: Â© 2016 American Association for Cancer Research. Small cell lung cancer
  (SCLC) is a devastating disease due to its propensity for early invasion and refractory
  relapse after initial treatment response. Although these aggressive traits have
  been associated with phenotypic heterogeneity, our understanding of this association
  remains incomplete. To fill this knowledge gap, we inferred a set of 33 transcription
  factors (TF) associated with gene signatures of the known neuroendocrine/ epithelial
  (NE) and non-neuroendocrine/mesenchymallike (ML) SCLC phenotypes. The topology of
  this SCLC TF network was derived from prior knowledge and was simulated using Boolean
  modeling. These simulations predicted that the network settles into attractors,
  or TF expression patterns, that correlate with NE or ML phenotypes, suggesting that
  TF network dynamics underlie the emergence of heterogeneous SCLC phenotypes. However,
  several cell lines and patient tumor specimens failed to correlate with either the
  NE or ML attractors. By flow cytometry, single cells within these cell lines simultaneously
  expressed surface markers of both NE and ML differentiation, confirming the existence
  of a \"hybrid\" phenotype. Upon exposure to standard-of-care cytotoxic drugs or
  epigenetic modifiers, NE and ML cell populations converged toward the hybrid state,
  suggesting possible escape fromtreatment. Our findings indicate that SCLC phenotypic
  heterogeneity can be specified dynamically by attractor states of a master regulatory
  TF network. Thus, SCLC heterogeneity may be best understood as states within an
  epigenetic landscape. Understanding phenotypic transitions within this landscape
  may provide insights to clinical applications.
