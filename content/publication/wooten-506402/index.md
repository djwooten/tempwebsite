abstract: Adopting a systems approach, we devise a general workflow to define actionable
  subtypes in human cancers. Applied to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the workflow
  identifies four subtypes based on global gene expression patterns and ontologies.
  Three correspond to known subtypes (SCLC-A, SCLC-N, and SCLC-Y), while the fourth
  is a previously undescribed ASCL1+ neuroendocrine variant (NEv2, or SCLC-A2). Tumor
  deconvolution with subtype gene signatures shows that all of the subtypes are detectable
  in varying proportions in human and mouse tumors. To understand how multiple stable
  subtypes can arise within a tumor, we infer a network of transcription factors and
  develop BooleaBayes, a minimally-constrained Boolean rule-fitting approach. In silico
  perturbations of the network identify master regulators and destabilizers of its
  attractors. Specific to NEv2, BooleaBayes predicts ELF3 and NR0B1 as master regulators
  of the subtype, and TCF3 as a master destabilizer. Since the four subtypes exhibit
  differential drug sensitivity, with NEv2 consistently least sensitive, these findings
  may lead to actionable therapeutic strategies that consider SCLC intratumoral heterogeneity.
  Our systems-level approach should generalize to other cancer types.
