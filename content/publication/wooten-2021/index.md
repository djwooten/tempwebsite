abstract: Drug combination discovery depends on reliable synergy metrics but no consensus
  exists on the correct synergy criterion to characterize combined interactions. The
  fragmented state of the field confounds analysis, impedes reproducibility, and delays
  clinical translation of potential combination treatments. Here we present a mass-action
  based formalism to quantify synergy. With this formalism, we clarify the relationship
  between the dominant drug synergy principles, and present a mapping of commonly
  used frameworks onto a unified synergy landscape. From this, we show how biases
  emerge due to intrinsic assumptions which hinder their broad applicability and impact
  the interpretation of synergy in discovery efforts. Specifically, we describe how
  traditional metrics mask consequential synergistic interactions, and contain biases
  dependent on the Hill-slope and maximal effect of single-drugs. We show how these
  biases systematically impact synergy classification in large combination screens,
  potentially misleading discovery efforts. Thus the proposed formalism can provide
  a consistent, unbiased interpretation of drug synergy, and accelerate the translatability
  of synergy studies.
