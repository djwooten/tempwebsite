abstract: "Two goals motivate treating diseases with drug combinations: reduce off-target
  toxicity by minimizing doses (synergistic potency) and improve outcomes by escalating
  effect (synergistic efficacy). Established drug synergy frameworks obscure such
  distinction, failing to harness the potential of modern chemical libraries. We therefore
  developed multi-dimensional synergy of combinations (MuSyC), a formalism based on
  a generalized, multi-dimensional Hill equation, which decouples synergistic potency
  and efficacy. In mutant-EGFR-driven lung cancer, MuSyC reveals that combining a
  mutant-EGFR inhibitor with inhibitors of other kinases may result only in synergistic
  potency, whereas synergistic efficacy can be achieved by co-targeting mutant-EGFR
  and epigenetic regulation or microtubule polymerization. In mutant-BRAF melanoma,
  MuSyC determines whether a molecular correlate of BRAFi insensitivity alters a BRAF
  inhibitor's potency, efficacy, or both. These findings showcase MuSyC's potential
  to transform the enterprise of drug-combination screens by precisely guiding translation
  of combinations toward dose reduction, improved efficacy, or both. Meyer et al.
  developed a framework for measuring drug combination synergy. The framework, termed
  MuSyC, distinguishes between two types of synergy. The first quantifies the change
  in the maximal effect with the combination (synergistic efficacy), and the second
  measures the change in a drug's potency due to the combination (synergistic potency).
  By decoupling these two synergies conflated in prior methods, MuSyC rationally guides
  discovery and translation of drug combinations for the improvement of therapeutic
  efficacy and reduction of off-target toxicities via dose reduction."
