abstract: FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive form of leukemia
  with poor prognosis. Treatment with FLT3 inhibitors frequently produces a clinical
  response, but the disease nevertheless often recurs. Recent studies have revealed
  system-wide gene expression changes in FLT3-mutant AML cell lines in response to
  drug treatment. Here we sought a systems-level understanding of how these cells
  mediate these drug-induced changes. Using RNAseq data from AML cells with an internal
  tandem duplication FLT3 mutation (FLT3-ITD) under six drug treatment conditions
  including quizartinib and dexamethasone, we identified seven distinct gene programs
  representing diverse biological processes involved in AML drug-induced changes.
  Based on the literature knowledge about genes from these modules, along with public
  gene regulatory network databases, we constructed a network of FLT3-ITD AML. Applying
  the BooleaBayes algorithm to this network and the RNAseq data, we created a probabilistic,
  data-driven dynamical model of acquired resistance to these drugs. Analysis of this
  model reveals several interventions that may disrupt targeted parts of the system-wide
  drug response. We anticipate co-targeting these points may result in synergistic
  treatments that can overcome resistance and prevent eventual recurrence.
