abstract: "© 2017 A cell's phenotype is the observable actualization of complex interactions
  between its genome, epigenome, and local environment. While traditional views in
  cancer have held that cellular and tumor phenotypes are largely functions of genomic
  instability, increasing attention has recently been given to epigenetic and microenvironmental
  influences. Such non-genetic factors allow cancer cells to experience intrinsic
  diversity and plasticity, and at the tumor level can result in phenotypic heterogeneity
  and treatment evasion. In 2006, Takahashi and Yamanaka exploited the epigenome's
  plasticity by “reprogramming” differentiated cells into a pluripotent state by inducing
  expression of a cocktail of four transcription factors. Recent advances in cancer
  biology have shown not only that cellular reprogramming is possible for malignant
  cells, but it may provide a foundation for future therapies. Nevertheless, cell
  reprogramming experiments are frequently plagued by low efficiency, activation of
  aberrant transcriptional programs, instability, and often rely on expertise gathered
  from systems which may not translate directly to cancer. Here, we review a theoretical
  framework tracing back to Waddington's epigenetic landscape which may be used to
  derive quantitative and qualitative understanding of cellular reprogramming. Implications
  for tumor heterogeneity, evolution and adaptation are discussed in the context of
  designing new treatments to re-sensitize recalcitrant tumors. This article is part
  of a Special Issue entitled: Evolutionary principles — heterogeneity in cancer?,
  edited by Dr. Robert A. Gatenby."
