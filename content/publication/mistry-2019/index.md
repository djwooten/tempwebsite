abstract: Whether patients with glioblastoma that contacts the ventricular-subventricular
  zone stem cell niche (VSVZ + GBM) have a distinct survival profile from VSVZ − GBM
  patients independent of other known predictors or molecular profiles is unclear.
  Using multivariate Cox analysis to adjust survival for widely-accepted predictors,
  hazard ratios (HRs) for overall (OS) and progression free (PFS) survival between
  VSVZ + GBM and VSVZ − GBM patients were calculated in 170 single-institution patients
  and 254 patients included in both The Cancer Genome (TCGA) and Imaging (TCIA) atlases.
  An adjusted, multivariable analysis revealed that VSVZ contact was independently
  associated with decreased survival in both datasets. TCGA molecular data analyses
  revealed that VSVZ contact by GBM was independent of mutational, DNA methylation,
  gene expression, and protein expression signatures in the bulk tumor. Therefore,
  while survival of GBM patients is independently stratified by VSVZ contact, with
  VSVZ + GBM patients displaying a poor prognosis, the VSVZ + GBMs do not possess
  a distinct molecular signature at the bulk sample level. Focused examination of
  the interplay between the VSVZ microenvironment and subsets of GBM cells proximal
  to this region is warranted.
