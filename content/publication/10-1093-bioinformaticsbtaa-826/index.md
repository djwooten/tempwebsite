abstract: Combinations of multiple pharmacological agents can achieve a substantial
  benefit over treatment with single agents alone. Combinations that achieve ‘more
  than the sum of their parts’ are called synergistic. There have been many proposed
  frameworks to understand and quantify drug combination synergy with different assumptions
  and domains of applicability. We introduce here synergy, a Python library that (i)
  implements a broad array of popular synergy models, (ii) provides tools for evaluating
  confidence intervals and conducting power analysis and (iii) provides standardized
  tools to analyze and visualize drug combinations and their synergies and antagonisms.synergy
  is available on all operating systems for Python &gt;=3.5. It is freely available
  from https://pypi.org/project/synergy, and its source code is available at https://github.com/djwooten/synergy.
  This software is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or later.Supplementary
  data are available at Bioinformatics online.
