abstract: Drug combination discovery depends on reliable synergy metrics; however,
  no consensus exists on the appropriate synergy model to prioritize lead candidates.
  The fragmented state of the field confounds analysis, reproducibility, and clinical
  translation of combinations. Here we present a mass-action based formalism to accurately
  measure the synergy of drug combinations. In this work, we clarify the relationship
  between the dominant drug synergy principles and show how biases emerge due to intrinsic
  assumptions which hinder their broad applicability. We further present a mapping
  of commonly used frameworks onto a unified synergy landscape, which identifies fundamental
  issues impacting the interpretation of synergy in discovery efforts. Specifically,
  we infer how traditional metrics mask consequential synergistic interactions, and
  contain biases dependent on the Hill-slope and maximal effect of single-drugs. We
  show how these biases systematically impact the classification of synergy in large
  combination screens misleading discovery efforts. The proposed approach has potential
  to accelerate the translatability and reproducibility of drug-synergy studies, by
  bridging the gap between the curative potential of drug mixtures and the complexity
  in their study.
